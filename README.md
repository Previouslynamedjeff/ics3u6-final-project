# Across The Sands

## Idea

The game I would like to make is  focused on the survival of the player in a desert environment.

The player will travel around a map, trying to survive for as long as possible.

- WASD keys to move
- Mouse to attack

## Layout

The main game takes place on a 2-dimensional plane.

## Programming Challenges

- Map
  - Displaying a miniature map in the corner of the screen
  - Processing the map in memory, loading/unloading parts of map
- Handling event systems
  - Different events occur at different frequencies, for example the day and night cycle, enemy spawning, and world updating
  - Detecting collisions and creating hitboxes for animated characters
- Sharing information between the different game entities
  - How do the enemies know where the player is?
  - How do the enemies know where they can move?
- Enemies
  - Generating enemies into the world
  - Creating “smart” and varied enemy behaviour
  - Pathfinding
